      <p>
        Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down
        to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about
        Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
        and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be
        accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn
        and explore.
